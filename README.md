![Project Logo](https://github.com/aka-0803/real-estate-price-prediction/blob/main/images/project_img.png?raw=true)
## Overview

This project focuses on predicting real estate prices in Bangalore using a linear regression model. The backend is built with Python Flask, and the frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and JS. The linear regression model is implemented using scikit-learn, and data processing involves NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, the dataset (`bangalore_house_prices.csv`) undergoes data cleaning and outlier removal to ensure the model's robustness.

## Model Training

The linear regression model is trained using scikit-learn. K-fold cross-validation and grid search CV methods are employed to find the best hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated on various metrics to ensure its predictive performance. Visualizations using matplotlib aid in understanding the model's behavior.
